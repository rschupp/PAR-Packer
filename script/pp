=head1 DESCRIPTION

F<pp> creates standalone executables from Perl programs, using the
compressed packager provided by L<PAR>, and dependency detection
heuristics offered by L<Module::ScanDeps>.  Source files are compressed
verbatim without compilation.

You may think of F<pp> as "F<perlcc> that works without hassle". :-)

A GUI interface is also available as the F<tkpp> command.

It does not provide the compilation-step acceleration provided by
F<perlcc> (however, see B<-f> below for byte-compiled, source-hiding
techniques), but makes up for it with better reliability, smaller
executable size, and full retrieval of original source code.

When a single input program is specified, the resulting executable will
behave identically as that program.  However, when multiple programs
are packaged, the produced executable will run the one that has the
same basename as C<$0> (i.e. the filename used to invoke it).  If
nothing matches, it dies with the error C<Can't open perl script "$0">.

=head1 OPTIONS

Options are available in a I<short> form and a I<long> form.  For
example, the three lines below are all equivalent:

    % pp -o output.exe input.pl
    % pp --output output.exe input.pl
    % pp --output=output.exe input.pl

Since the command lines can become sufficiently long to reach the limits
imposed by some shells, it is possible to have I<pp> read some of its
options from one or more text files. The basic usage is to just include
an argument starting with an 'at' (@) sigil. This argument will be
interpeted as a file to read options from. Mixing ordinary options
and C<@file> options is possible. This is implemented using the
L<Getopt::ArgvFile> module, so read its documentation for advanced usage.

=over 4

=item B<-a>, B<--addfile>=I<FILE>|I<DIR>

Add an extra file into the package.  If the file is a directory, recursively
add all files inside that directory, with links turned into actual files.

By default, files are placed under C</> inside the package with their
original names.  You may override this by appending the target filename
after a C<;>, like this:

    % pp -a "old_filename.txt;new_filename.txt"
    % pp -a "old_dirname;new_dirname"

You may specify C<-a> multiple times.

=item B<-A>, B<--addlist>=I<FILE>

Read a list of file/directory names from I<FILE>, adding them into the
package.  Each line in I<FILE> is taken as an argument to B<-a> above.

You may specify C<-A> multiple times.

=item B<-B>, B<--bundle>

Bundle core modules in the resulting package.  This option is enabled
by default, except when C<-p> or C<-P> is specified.

Since PAR version 0.953, this also strips any local paths from the
list of module search paths C<@INC> before running the contained
script.

=item B<-C>, B<--clean>

Clean up temporary files extracted from the application at runtime.
By default, these files are cached in the temporary directory; this
allows the program to start up faster next time.

=item B<-c>, B<--compile>

Run C<perl -c inputfile> to determine additonal run-time dependencies.

=item B<-d>, B<--dependent>

Reduce the executable size by not including a copy of perl interpreter.
Executables built this way will need a separate F<perl5x.dll>
or F<libperl.so> to function correctly.  This option is only available
if perl is built as a shared library.

=item B<-e>, B<--eval>=I<STRING>

Package a one-liner, much the same as C<perl -e '...'>

=item B<-x>, B<--execute>

Run C<perl inputfile> to determine additonal run-time dependencies.

=item B<-X>, B<--exclude>=I<MODULE>

Exclude the given module from the dependency search path and from the
package. If the given file is a zip or par or par executable, all the files
in the given file (except MANIFEST, META.yml and script/*) will be
excluded and the output file will "use" the given file at runtime.

=item B<-f>, B<--filter>=I<FILTER>

Filter source script(s) with a L<PAR::Filter> subclass.  You may specify
multiple such filters.

If you wish to hide the source code from casual prying, this will do:

    % pp -f Bleach source.pl

Users with Perl 5.8.1 and above may also try out the experimental
byte-compiling filter, which will strip away all comments and indents:

    % pp -f Bytecode source.pl

=item B<-g>, B<--gui>

Build an executable that does not have a console window. This option is
ignored on non-MSWin32 platforms or when C<-p> is specified.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Show basic usage information.

=item B<-i>, B<--icon>=I<FILE>

Specify an icon file (in F<.ico>, F<.exe> or F<.dll> format) for the
executable. This option is ignored on non-MSWin32 platforms or when C<-p>
is specified.

=item B<-N>, B<--info>=I<KEY=VAL>

Add additional information for the packed file, both in C<META.yml>
and in the executable header (if applicable).  The name/value pair is
joined by C<=>.  You may specify C<-N> multiple times, or use C<;> to
link several pairs.

For Win32 executables, these special C<KEY> names are recognized:

    Comments        CompanyName     FileDescription FileVersion
    InternalName    LegalCopyright  LegalTrademarks OriginalFilename
    ProductName     ProductVersion

=item B<-I>, B<--lib>=I<DIR>

Add the given directory to the perl library file search path.  May
be specified multiple times.

=item B<-l>, B<--link>=I<FILE>|I<LIBRARY>

Add the given shared library (a.k.a. shared object or DLL) into the
packed file.  Also accepts names under library paths; i.e.
C<-l ncurses> means the same thing as C<-l libncurses.so> or
C<-l /usr/local/lib/libncurses.so> in most Unixes.  May be specified
multiple times.

=item B<-L>, B<--log>=I<FILE>

Log the output of packaging to a file rather than to stdout.

=item B<-F>, B<--modfilter>=I<FILTER[=REGEX]>,

Filter included perl module(s) with a L<PAR::Filter> subclass.
You may specify multiple such filters. By default, the I<PodStrip> filter
is applied.

Since PAR 0.958, you can use an optional regular expression (I<REGEX> above)
to select the files in the archive which should be filtered. Example:

  pp -o foo.exe -F Bleach=warnings\.pm$ foo.pl

This creates a binary executable F<foo.exe> from F<foo.pl> packaging all files
as usual except for files ending in C<warnings.pm> which are filtered with
L<PAR::Filter::Bleach>.

=item B<-M>, B<--module>=I<MODULE>

Add the specified module into the package, along with its dependencies.
Also accepts filenames relative to the C<@INC> path; i.e. C<-M
Module::ScanDeps> means the same thing as C<-M Module/ScanDeps.pm>.

If I<MODULE> has an extension that is not C<.pm>/C<.ix>/C<.al>, it will not
be scanned for dependencies, and will be placed under C</> instead of
C</lib/> inside the PAR file.  This use is deprecated -- consider using
the B<-a> option instead.

You may specify C<-M> multiple times.

=item B<-m>, B<--multiarch>

Build a multi-architecture PAR file.  Implies B<-p>.

=item B<-n>, B<--noscan>

Skip the default static scanning altogether, using run-time
dependencies from B<-c> or B<-x> exclusively.

=item B<-o>, B<--output>=I<FILE>

File name for the final packaged executable.

=item B<-p>, B<--par>

Create PAR archives only; do not package to a standalone binary.

=item B<-P>, B<--perlscript>

Create stand-alone perl script; do not package to a standalone binary.

=item B<-r>, B<--run>

Run the resulting packaged script after packaging it.

=item B<-S>, B<--save>

Do not delete generated PAR file after packaging.

=item B<-s>, B<--sign>

Cryptographically sign the generated PAR or binary file using
L<Module::Signature>.

=item B<-T>, B<--tempcache>

Set the program unique part of the cache directory name that is used
if the program is run without -C. If not set, a hash of the executable
is used.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose>[=I<NUMBER>]

Increase verbosity of output; I<NUMBER> is an integer from C<1> to C<3>,
C<3> being the most verbose.  Defaults to C<1> if specified without an
argument.  Alternatively, B<-vv> sets verbose level to C<2>, and B<-vvv>
sets it to C<3>.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Display the version number and copyrights of this program.

=item B<-z>, B<--compress>=I<NUMBER>

Set zip compression level; I<NUMBER> is an integer from C<0> to C<9>,
C<0> = no compression, C<9> = max compression.  Defaults to C<6> if
B<-z> is not used.

=item PP_OPTS

Command-line options (switches).  Switches in this variable are taken
as if they were on every F<pp> command line.

=head1 NOTES

Here are some recipes showing how to utilize F<pp> to bundle
F<source.pl> with all its dependencies, on target machines with
different expected settings:

=over 4

=item Stand-alone setup

    % pp -o packed.exe source.pl        # makes packed.exe
    # Now, deploy 'packed.exe' to target machine...
    $ packed.exe                        # run it

=item Perl interpreter only, without core modules:

    % pp -B -P -o packed.pl source.pl   # makes packed.exe
    # Now, deploy 'packed.exe' to target machine...
    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it

=item Perl with core module installed:

    % pp -P -o packed.pl source.pl      # makes packed.exe
    # Now, deploy 'packed.pl' to target machine...
    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it

=item Perl with PAR.pm and its dependencies installed:

    % pp -p source.pl                   # makes source.par
    % echo "use PAR 'source.par';" > packed.pl;
    % cat source.pl >> packed.pl;       # makes packed.pl
    # Now, deploy 'source.par' and 'packed.pl' to target machine...
    $ perl packed.pl                    # run it

=back

Note that even if your perl was built with a shared library, the
'Stand-alone setup' above will I<not> need a separate F<perl5x.dll>
or F<libperl.so> to function correctly.  Use C<--dependent> if you
are willing to ship the shared library with the application, which
can significantly reduce the executable size.
